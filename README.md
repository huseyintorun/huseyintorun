- 👋 Hi, I’m @huseyintorun
- I am working at a germany based Training Simulator devolopment company located in Munich.
- This Simulator Software is capable of creating / playing plenty of tactical scenarios, which are basicly a combination of artifical intelligence 
  and related simlator cabines, simultaneously in a virtual world server and a choosen area database. 
  I am responsible of creating new test cases and/or scenarios for functional tests/end to end tests. For this purpose, in our framework we are using
  XML files, which is able to communicate with simulator software.
